# Maximum Linked Data

Let's try to use as many triples as we can to describe [https://scholarworks.iupui.edu/handle/1805/6451](https://scholarworks.iupui.edu/handle/1805/6451).

Pull requests **very** welcome! 

Let's see how many N-Quads we can get to before [OR2015](http://www.or2015.net/) starts.

##Rules: 

You can only use data that can be found at [https://scholarworks.iupui.edu/handle/1805/6451](https://scholarworks.iupui.edu/handle/1805/6451). For example, we can't go and find the http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/#term_homepage for the author. 

##Current status: 

* 5680 N-Quads at 1,376,898 Characters
* 8 Prefixes/Contexts

##Tools:
